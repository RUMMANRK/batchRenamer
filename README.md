# batchRenamer
Python script to edit the batch renames after Windows Explorer is done with its own batch rename when you select a bunch of files and click rename.


I made this as practice and since I face this situation a lot working with series of files, made sense to scriptify it and hone my GitHub skills at the same time. 
It's also something I wrote to get over the fear of pushing projects onto GitHub. I know it's silly but anyone who's this far in might be wondering why I basically made a child's three lego block table equivalent of a Python script that no one will use.


## Usage

Default Pattern: ```[theKeyYouSpecify][fileNumber].[fileExtension]```

Step 1: 
    You will be asked for the pattern key you used for the Windows Explorer batch name

Step 2: 
    You will then enter the key you want to replace the Windows Explorer's one with

Step 3: 
    You have to then enter the file extension of the entire process. 
    
Step 4:
    Insert the ranges it will count over
